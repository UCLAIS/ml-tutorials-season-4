    "\n",
    "We are proud to present you with a multi-class classification challenge on predicting Premier League match results from August 2003 up until November 2022. This is a great opportunity to experiment with and learn about a variety of core concepts in machine learning and their implementation using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will guide you through the various general stages involved in end-to-end machine learning projects, including data visualisation, data preprocessing, model selection, model training and model evaluation. Finally, you will be able to submit your test set predictions to [DOXA](https://doxaai.com/).\n",

    "**Background**: The Premier League is a professional association football league established in 1992. It forms the highest level in the English football league system and is the most highly viewed sports league in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The league contains 20 clubs, and during a Premier League season, each club plays one home and one away match with every other team in the league. As a result, every team plays 38 matches each season. A match victory gives the winning team three points in the standings, while a draw hands both teams one point each.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each season, the three worst-performing teams are relegated to the first division of the English Football League (EFL) &ndash; the EFL Championship &ndash; and the top three EFL Championship teams are promoted to the Premier League in their place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: The main objective for this challenge is to predict the result of a past Premier League match given some information about how the home and away teams performed during the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**: We have sourced and aggregated match information dating back to August 2003 from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php)."

If our model starts to fit to the noise (or residual variation) in our training dataset, rather than the underlying function we are trying to learn (the signal), we end up with **overfitting**; and likewise, if the representation of our model is not rich enough to encode the true underlying relationship in the data, our model ends up **underfitting**. Both issues cause our model to perform worse when evaluated out-of-sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of different models available to us, each with a range of **hyperparameters** we can tune to affect the learning process; however, if we use the performance of our models on the test set as the basis for updating hyperparameters, we stand the real chance of leaking information about and overfitting to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to further subdivide our training dataset into a training set and a completely separate **validation set**, but training data is precious a lot of the time, and we would not want to overfit to that too. An alternative approach here is to perform (**stratified**) **k-fold cross-validation**, where we (randomly) partition the data into `k` \"folds\", train `k` models using each fold for validation and the remaining folds for training, and average the results. You can read more about this in the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this all together, we finally just need a strategy for optimising our hyperparameters. One (albeit potentially slow) way is just to perform a **cross-validated grid search** over a grid of hyperparameter values we want to investigate in order to try out a range of different combinations. When we think we have found the model with the best set of hyperparameters, we can retrain it on all of the training data and then evaluate it on the test set. Bam! 😎\n",

    "We can now try applying what we know by performing a small grid search of our own on a [linear support vector classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html) (or `LinearSVC`) to find the value of the hyperparameter `C` (which controls the strength of regularisation that is applied) that gives the best performing model!"

Here, there is a clear home advantage, so we might want to consider other metrics.\n",

    "## Possible Improvements & Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations &ndash; you have made it to the end! We hope you have enjoyed learning about and applying machine learning to this challenge. Hopefully, you can now start experimenting with your own ideas to see how you can improve the performance of your model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few ideas to get you started on making improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Collection**\n",
    "- You are more than welcome to try sourcing and cleaning additional data (such as individual player rating data or even shot-level data) to help you train your model &ndash; just be careful not to accidentally train on what we are trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Visualisation**\n",
    "- Visualise other features as well (beyond just shots on target) to see what other features correlate well with the chance of a team winning. If there are any features that do not correlate particularly well with the chance of a team winning, perhaps it should be removed.\n",
    "- Produce a correlation matrix to do this all in a single visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "- Apply the [PCA algorithm](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) to reduce the dimensionality of our data by projecting each input sample onto a lower dimensional subspace while trying to maximally preserve the variation in the data. The number of components you pick is a hyperparameter that you can tune.\n",
    "- Determine how you can incorporate dates into the model; teams are likely to vary in performance over time.\n",
    "- Explore how you could implement [Elo ratings](https://blog.collegefootballdata.com/talking-tech-elo-ratings/) to track the performance of a team each season.\n",
    "- Experiment with creating other offensive and defensive metrics of your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Model Selection**\n",
    "- Try out a wider selection of model types beyond those listed in the notebook, such as [gradient boosting classifiers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html) and [ensemble methods](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html).\n",
    "- [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) is not your only option, other hyperparameter optimisers are availabe in `scikit-learn`, such as [HalvingGridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV.html) and [RandomizedSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html).\n",
    "- Check out using [BayesSearchCV](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/auto_examples/sklearn-gridsearchcv-replacement.html) from the [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/) package, which searches the space of hyperparameters using Bayesian optimisation and is a drop-in replacement for [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closing Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more realistic scenario, you might instead want to build a model to predict the outcomes of future matches, rather than the results of past ones (which you could probably look up!); moreover, the test set would only contain features we could know in advance of the match happening, such as `date` (where dates are in the future), `home_team` and `away_team`. How might you be able to adapt the model we have been building together to predict future match results?\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we hope that you have found this to be a useful and enjoyable exercise in exploring and gaining exposure to some fascinating ideas and concepts in machine learning. We look forward to seeing what you build! Do continue the conversation on the [DOXA Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/MUvbQ3UYcf). 😎"
